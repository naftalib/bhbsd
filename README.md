## [live demo here](https://naftalib.github.io/bhbsd/)

This app was an interview assignment for an investment company.
The requirement was to fetch JSON data containing profiles of investors and create a responsive display of the first 30 profiles. When an image is clicked a modal opens displaying that particular investors details.
