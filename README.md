## [live demo here](https://naftalib.github.io/bhbsd/)

This app was an assignment for an investment company.
The requirement was to fetch JSON data containing profiles of investors from a given API endpoint and create a grid display of the first 30 profiles. When an image is clicked a modal opens displaying that particular investors details.
In addition, I needed to make the app responsive for mobile too, which I achieved by manipulating the window.innerWidth property.
