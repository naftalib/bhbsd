Interview assignment.

# Summary:
Currently this app is functional and has met all the requirements that were emphasized.
However, being that this was a coding challenge I focused mainly on achieving functionality. There is a lot of room for refactoring to gain any kind of production level proficiency code. 
Therefore, please keep the following points in mind.

1. The requirement for responsiveness has been met, however I decided that since React doesn't use standard CSS media queries and I didn't have the ideal time to begin experimenting with plugins and the like. Therefore, I added a simple in-line conditional that adjusts the display accordingly. The take away is that the display will not adjust dynamically to a manual resize of the browser, rather I used the native “window.innerWidth” property to detect the view port size upon load. So just hit refresh in order to see the change take effect.
